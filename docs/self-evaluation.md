## Total ( 17.5 / 20 )

## Glows:
- I built my first-ever application from scratch using the MVC design pattern!
- The MVP design was successful, and I received great feedback.
- I'm pleased that I learned about video poker and its differences from classic poker. Gathering requirements was crucial!
- I managed my time well, leaving room for documentation and adjusting the layout for mobile screens.

## Grows:
- I regret not testing the winning combination logic thoroughly. I should have allocated more time to this task. How can I implement unit and acceptance tests effectively?
- I need to keep better track of my presentation timing, being concise and delivering only essential information.
- I have a lot of features in the backlog. I plan to enhance some of them while polishing up my portfolio.
